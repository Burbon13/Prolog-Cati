# Prolog Homework instructions

You will find the solved exercises (from "Devoir 2 en" file) inside the **src** folder.

Each exercise has its own file (ex1.pl, ex2.pl, ex3.pl).

I have also written a series of tests for exercises 1 and 2. You will find the instructions on how to run the tests inside the files.

## Outcomes

- I have gained a better understanding of how Prolog works (backtracking, cuts, etc.).
- I have managed to develop a declarative programming mindset.
