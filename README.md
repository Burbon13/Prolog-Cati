# Prolog Homework 2 instructions

You will find the solved exercises (from "Devoir 2 en" file) inside the **src** folder.

Each exercise has its own file (ex1.pl, ex2.pl, ex3.pl).

I have also written a series of tests (e.g. ex2_test.pl). You will find the instructions on how to run the tests inside the files.
